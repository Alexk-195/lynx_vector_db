### TODOS
Make sure you have read other md files in this directory before start implementation.

- [x] Add support for coverage build and run to CMakeLists.txt. Use it from setup.sh script. Remove it from Makefile.
- [x] Review src/lib/vector_database_impl.cpp for correctness. Implement save() and load() in src/lib/vector_database_impl.cpp
- [ ] Strip down Makefile to functionality of building lib and executables. Remove unit test build.
